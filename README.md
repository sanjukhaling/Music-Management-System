"I developed a Music Management System using Python and Django REST Framework for the backend, with Docker for containerization. The project involves a RESTful API that allows for managing musicians, songs, and albums. It includes features like user authentication, CRUD operations for music data, and interaction with a PostgreSQL database. Docker was used to create an isolated environment for easier deployment and scalability."
